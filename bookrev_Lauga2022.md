## Book Review of Eric Lauga's *Fluid Mechanics:  A Very Short Introduction*


*Fluid Mechanics:  A Very Short Introduction*, by Eric Lauga (Oxford University Press, 2022).  Very Short Introductions, vol. 708.  Reviewed by

The technical literature on fluid mechanics is vast, and blessed with many writers of varying styles.  However, there is a notable gap in the literature 
for readers who would like some exposure to the field before they've mastered vector calculus.  The classic little book by Ascher Shapiro, 
*Shape and Flow* (1961), and the little-known, album-sized volume by Hans Lugt, *Vortex Flow in Nature and Technology* (1983), both require only high school 
level algebra, and ably serve as nontechnical introductions to fluid flow.  Unfortunately both are long out of print.  Since the demise of those volumes, 
only the delightful tome by Philip Ball, *Flow* (2009), which doesn't require any mathematics at all, has been available...until now.

A new entry in Oxford University Press's venerable *Very Short Introductions* series has just appeared, *Fluid Mechanics* by Eric Lauga.  In my view, 
this book may be read by anyone with a working knowledge of the first semester of introductory physics.  The author freely uses reasoning based on 
Newton's laws of motion, force balance, and mechanical energy conservation, for example.  All calculations are at a high-school algebra level, and 
calculus is stated to be beyond the scope of the book.  

Lauga's book is limited by the format of the *Very Short Introductions* series:   the 140-or-so pages are small, but illustrations are plentiful.  
The small size helps make the book friendly, of course.  Though it is probably more mathematical than most *VSI*s, it is as readable as the best of 
them, in my opinion.  Good writing is essential for a book of this type, and the author doesn't disappoint.

The first chapter outlines the macroscopic, continuum approach taken in the book, and covers hydrostatics, surface tension, and wetting.  The second 
chapter introduces the Eulerian velocity field, flow kinematics, forces of a fluid parcel, and viscosity.  Chapter 3 is on "Pipes", which covers 
Poiseuille flow, the transition to turbulence, blood flow, and industrial applications.  Chapter 4 is a primer on dimensional analysis, taking the 
reader on a tour of key flows characterized by nondimensional numbers such as the Reynolds, Froude, and Rossby numbers.  Chapter 5 is on boundary layers 
and separation, with the obligatory discussion of D'Alembert's paradox.  Chapter 6 introduces vortex dynamics, including Helmholtz's vortex laws, 
aerodynamic lift, and the Magnus effect.  Chapter 7 provides a tour of hydrodynamic instabilities, including the Rayleigh-Taylor, Rayleigh-Plateau, 
Taylor-Couette, Saffman-Taylor, and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities.  The final chapter mentions a number of fields of contemporary research in hydrodynamics.  Overall the author has made a reasonable choice of topics to cover; specialist readers such as myself will disagree on which omissions are the most egregious, as we inevitably would for any book of this length.

The author is an applied mathematician, and at the time of publication, co-lead editor of *Physical Review Fluids*, a major journal in the field, and 
a faculty member at Cambridge University's famous "DAMTP" (Dept. of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics).  This book fits neatly between the 
completely nontechnical one by Ball (2009) and the more mathematical sampler dish by Worster (2009), which requires vector calculus and differential 
equations, and while not a textbook, shows you some serious fluid dynamical calculations and problem solving.  Indeed, Lauga cites both of these earlier 
works in his brief but well-curated "Further reading" list.
