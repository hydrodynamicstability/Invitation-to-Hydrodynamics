## Fluid Mechanics in the Physics Curriculum

"The integration of continuum mechanics into the physics curriculum could yield many benefits.  I do not presume that this integration would have to occur as a single separate course.  Greater attention to this field could be distributed in various parts of the undergraduate and graduate curricula, including courses in classical mechanics, condensed matter physics, and so on."

In the following, I discuss encounters with fluid mechanics, as it appears in textbooks intended for major subjects in the core undergraduate and graduate physics curriculum.

### Introductory physics

Nearly every introductory physics text includes coverage of fluid mechanics.  Conventional topics include density; pressure, its measurement, and its variation with depth/altitude; Pascal's Principle; buoyancy and Archimedes' Principle; classification of fluid flows; streamlines and the hydraulic continuity equation; the Bernoulli equation; the Venturi effect; Torricelli's efflux problem; and viscosity and the Reynolds Number.  Sometimes surface tension and capillarity; Poiseuille flow; aerodynamic lift and drag; and the Magnus effect are also discussed.  

The Bernoulli equation and aerodynamic lift are particularly tricky topics that some texts foul up.  A number of older texts incorrectly attributed aerodynamic lift solely to the cambered profile of an airfoil, without noting (by Newton's third law) that there must be a downward force (and thus deflection) on the air flowing around the airfoil.  Here is an example from Nelkon & Parker (1995, Ch. 4, pp. 127-128).

This fallacy is so pervasive that it even led Albert Einstein to propose an airfoil design in 1916 that failed miserably when tested by a Berlin aircraft company.  The test pilot, Paul Ehrhardt, survived, but years later, a few months before Einstein died, he told Ehrhardt "I have often been ashamed of my folly of those days."  (A second test pilot, Otto Reichert, crashed but survived.)

When I was a graduate teaching assistant in the late 1990s, I encountered a more elementary error.  Halliday, Resnick, & Walker (1997, vol. 2, chapter 15) include the following homework problems.



These problems are meant to be solved using Bernoulli's equation, but this requires you to tacitly assume that there is a streamline connecting the air outside the building with air inside the building.  However, typically the outside air's streamlines will be flowing *around* the building, not through it.  I am tempted to call this bad physics, an example of what Shaw (2015) called the "often over-simplified and even misleading treatments of mass continuity and the Bernoulli equation in introductory physics courses."
