## Fluid Mechanics in the Physics Curriculum

"The integration of continuum mechanics into the physics curriculum could yield many benefits.  I do not presume that this integration would have to occur as a single separate course.  Greater attention to this field could be distributed in various parts of the undergraduate and graduate curricula, including courses in classical mechanics, condensed matter physics, and so on."

In the following, I discuss encounters with fluid mechanics, as it appears in textbooks intended for major subjects in the core undergraduate and graduate physics curriculum.

### Introductory physics

Nearly every introductory physics text includes coverage of fluid mechanics.  Conventional topics include density; pressure, its measurement, and its variation with depth/altitude; Pascal's Principle; buoyancy and Archimedes' Principle; classification of fluid flows; streamlines and the hydraulic continuity equation; the Bernoulli equation; the Venturi effect; Torricelli's efflux problem; and viscosity and the Reynolds Number.  Sometimes surface tension and capillarity; Poiseuille flow; aerodynamic lift and drag; and the Magnus effect are also discussed.  

The Bernoulli equation and aerodynamic lift are particularly tricky topics that some texts foul up.  A number of older texts incorrectly attributed aerodynamic lift solely to the cambered profile of an airfoil, without noting (by Newton's third law) that there must be a downward force (and thus deflection) on the air flowing around the airfoil.  Here is a typical example from Nelkon & Parker (1995, Ch. 4, pp. 127-128):

The streamlines under the airfoil appear to be almost completely horizontal; without an angle of attack, this profile cannot generate any lifting force!  While most well designed airfoils have camber, this design element is intended to enhance lift generated by flying at a nonzero angle of attack, rather than being the primary source of lift.  As Alexander (2009) notes,

"Airplane designers are intensely interested in how much lift a wing produces under different conditions, one of which is called the angle of attack--the angle between the wing and the direction it moves through the air....Camber can increase the amount of lift that a wing produces at any given angle of attack without much increase in drag....In fact, more than a few airplanes fly with zero-camber airfoils, usually called symmetrical airfoils.  Many supersonic airplanes have symmetrical airfoils, as did at least one Second World War fighter (the Bell P-39 Airacobra) and one small jet airliner (the Fokker F-28 Fellowship).  A wing with a symmetrical airfoil can still produce lift; it just does so entirely with angle of attack....Aerobatic airplanes that need to be able to fly equally well when they are upside down and right side up (such as the Pitts Special) also use zero-camber wings.  These airplanes ofen compesnate for slightly less efficient wings with significantly more pwoerful engines."

A related fallacy, based on a Venturi effect argument, led Albert Einstein to propose a "cat's back" airfoil design in 1916 that failed miserably when tested by a Berlin aircraft company.  The test pilot, Paul Ehrhardt, survived, but years later, a few months before Einstein died, he told Ehrhardt "I have often been ashamed of my folly of those days."  (A second test pilot, Otto Reichert, crashed but survived.)  "Einstein's folly" is discussed by Bloor (2011, pp. 296-302) and Calaprice et al. (2015, p. 297).  Bloor writes that "Einstein had little knowledge of current developments in the field of aerodynamics.  This episode is a salutory reminder of the difference between fundamental physics and technical mechanics.  Eminence in the former does not guarantee competence in the latter."

When I was a graduate teaching assistant in the late 1990s, I encountered a more elementary error.  Halliday, Resnick, & Walker (1997, vol. 2, chapter 15) include the following homework problems.

These problems are meant to be solved using Bernoulli's equation, but this requires you to tacitly assume that there is a streamline connecting the air outside the building with air inside the building.  However, typically the outside air's streamlines will be flowing *around* the building, not through it.  I am tempted to call this bad physics, an example of what [R. A. Shaw](https://doi.org/10.1119/1.4929153) called the "often over-simplified and even misleading treatments of mass continuity and the Bernoulli equation in introductory physics courses."

### Classical mechanics

When I was an undergraduate in the early 1990s, most intermediate mechanics texts omitted fluids entirely.  Symon (1971, Ch. 8) and Arya (1997, Ch. 15) were two exceptions, both including a chapter on the mechanics of continuous media, consisting of vibrations on strings as well as fluid dynamics and sound waves.  Corben and Stehle (1994, Sec. 81) devote less space to fluid dynamics, but at least they include the Navier-Stokes equations as a "special application".  At the graduate level, the texts of Fetter &  Walecka (1980) and Jose & Saletan (1998, Sec. 9.5) are notable examples that include fluid dynamics.  Fetter & Walecka are particularly notable for celebrating the whole of continuum mechanics in the entire second half of their book (Ch. 7-13).  Finally, Appendix 2 of the classic Arnol'd (1989) discusses the formal correspondence between the Euler equations of rigid body dynamics and the Euler equations of ideal fluid flow.

In the years since my studenthood, more undergraduate mechanics texts are including chapters on fluid dynamics, though many of the most popular texts continue to competely ignore the topic.  Examples of the more enlightened texts include Taylor (2005, Ch. 16), Chaichian et al. (2012, Ch. 6), Deshmukh (2020, Ch. 11), and Hamill (2022, Ch. 19).  Jerry Gollub himself used the undergrad intermediate mechanics course to introduce fluid dynamics to his physics students, so it is heartening to see further progress in this direction.
