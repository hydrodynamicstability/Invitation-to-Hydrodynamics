## Books on fluid and continuum mechanics written by physicists

I have listed all the books on continuum, fluid, and solid mechanics and thermodynamics written by physicists (or astronomers) of an introductory or general nature that I know of.
I've confined the scope of this list to include works published after the Second World War and available in the English language.  I have not included
more specialized works on continuum mechanics for geophysics, atmospheric dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, plasma physics, astrophysical hydrodynamics, microhydrodynamics, and so on. 
Some elements of elasticity theory typically appear in texts on solid state physics, while elements of hydrodynamics less commonly appear in condensed matter physics texts -- these too will be omitted here.

This list is surely not complete, but I would like to make it so.  If you believe you know of an omission, please contact me at (remove spaces) c t o n g "at" m a i l a p s . o r g.

Commentary on these books is forthcoming.

### Books covering solid mechanics

I am admittedly very unfamiliar with the literature in this field, so this section is especially prone to incompleteness.

- Lev D. Landau and Evgenii M Lifshitz, 1986:  *Theory of Elasticity*, 3d ed., revised and enlarged by E. M. Lifshitz, A. M. Kosevich, and L. P. Pitaevskii.  Translated by J. B. Sykes and W. H. Reid.  Course of Theoretical Physics, Vol. 7.  Butterworth-Heinemann.

- Adrian P. Sutton, 2020:  *Physics of Elasticity and Crystal Defects*.  Oxford Series on Materials Modelling.  Oxford University Press.

### Books covering acoustics

Despite the relatively few physicists who work in acoustics in recent decades, a surprisingly large number of the key books in the field have been written
by physicists.  Lord Rayleigh's classic *Theory of Sound* ranks first among these.  As this topic deserves a separate page of its own, which is beyond the scope
of my present efforts, I will not attempt to list such books here.  Let it suffice to mention the names of illustrious authors such as Leo Beranek, Eugene Skudrzyk, 
Philip M. Morse and K. Uno Ingard, Allen D. Pierce, David T. Blackstock, and Thomas D. Rossing.  Also worthy of mention is the workhorse text by 
Kinsler/Frey/Coppens/Sanders and the textbook by Berg and Stork.


### Other books by physicists that you should be aware of

As a point of privilege, this section is more subjective.

- Sybren R. DeGroot and Peter Mazur, 1984:  *Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics*.  Dover.  (Original edition published by North-Holland, 1962.)
    - A foundational monograph on the linear thermodynamics of irreversible processes, a slightly misleading name since the theory is inherently nonlinear.  Hydrodynamics and closely related phemonena are at the heart of this theory.
- Roman Jackiw, 2002:  *Lectures on Fluid Dynamics: A Particle Theorist's View of Supersymmetric, Non-Abelian, Noncommutative Fluid Mechanics and d-Branes*. Springer.
    - Presents a new formulation of hydrodynamics, "an ancient field theory, but which can be enhanced by the ideas that we gleaned from particle physics."  
- Robert Bruce Lindsay, 1960:  *Mechanical Radiation*.  The International Series in Pure and Applied Physics.  McGraw-Hill.  \[Out of print\]
    - Focuses on wave phenomena in various classical media:  strings, membranes, rods, plates, elastic media, incompressible fluids, sound in fluids, and applictions in acoustics and geophysics, oceanography, and meteorology.  The final chapter delves into a range of special topics such as statistical physics, electron "hydrodynamics" in superconductivity, and liquid helium.
- Hans J. Lugt, 1983:  *Vortex Flow in Nature and Technology*.  Wiley-Interscience.  (Original German edition, 1979.  English edition reprinted by Krieger, 1995.) \[Out of print\]
    - A surprisingly nontechnical exposition of vortex flow, a central concept in hydrodynamics.  Packed with illustrations, it would make an excellent introduction to hydrodynamics for a student who hasn't yet mastered vector calculus, yet could also grip the attention of a seasoned physicist.  This book deserves to be better known in the fluid mechanics community.

Finally, having mentioned Lord Rayleigh, Lev Landau, and Kip Thorne above, fluid mechanics books by two more Nobel laureates in physics are worthy of note:

- Hannes Alfven and Carl-Gunne Falthammar, 1963: *Cosmical Electrodynamics*, 2d edition. International Series of Monographs on Physics.  Oxford University Press.  (Original edition, 1950.)
    - Alfven is the founder of modern magnetohydrodynamics; this was his book on the topic.
- Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, 1981:  *Hydrodynamic and Hydromagnetic Stability*.  Dover.  (Original edition published in the International Series of Monographs on Physics, by Oxford University Press, 1961.)
    - A landmark contribution by a legendary astrophysicist.  Anyone interested in hydrodynamic instabilities must own this book.
