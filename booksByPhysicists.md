## Books on fluid and continuum mechanics written by physicists

I have listed all the books on continuum, fluid, and solid mechanics written by physicists (or astronomers) of an introductory or general nature that I know of.  I've confined the scope of this list to include works published after the Second World War and available in the English language.  

I have not included
more specialized works on continuum mechanics for geophysics, atmospheric dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, plasma physics, astrophysical hydrodynamics, microhydrodynamics, and so on.  Some elements of elasticity theory typically appear in texts on solid state physics, while elements of hydrodynamics less commonly appear in condensed matter physics texts -- these too will be omitted here.  Finally, hydrodynamics is often a canonical example of nonequilibrium thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, and I have not listed books in these fields that provide extensive coverage of this connection, with the exception of the classic by DeGroot & Mazur. The reason for these omissions is that such works often fail to provide a general view of hydrodynamics, to include for instance the topic of aerodynamic lift.  (Any physicist who finds Bernoulli's equation applied to cambered airfoils to be a satisfactory explanation of aerodynamic lift needs to explain how aerobatic aircraft can fly upside down!  See further discussion at [Fluid Mechanics in the Physics Curriculum](curriculum.md).)

This list is surely not complete, but I would like to make it so.  If you believe you know of an omission, please contact me at (remove spaces) c t o n g "at" m a i l a p s . o r g.

Commentary on these books is being added gradually over time, so please consider this a work in progress.  I provide additional commentary on Sommerfeld, Landau/Lifshitz, and Thorne/Blandford at a companion page on [Continuum mechanics in the great physics courses](physicscourses.md).

### Books covering continuum mechanics

- Avadh Behari Bhatia and Ram N. Singh, 1986:  *Mechanics of Deformable Media*.  Graduate Student Series in Physics.  Adam Hilger/IOP.
    - This compact book was prepared from A. B. Bhatia's lectures and, due to his death during its writing, published posthumously.  A. B. Bhatia (1921-1984) was a theorist in Canada who worked in multiple areas such as condensed matter, nuclear, astrophysics, and optics.  Coverage in this book is limited to the most basic topics (e.g., nothing on boundary layers, instabilities, or turbulence, though there is a chapter on sound propagation).  No solutions to problems are provided.
    
- Leonid M. Brekhovskikh and Valery Goncharov, 1994:  *Mechanics of Continua and Wave Dynamics*, 2d edition.  Translated by V. Vavilova.  Springer Series on Wave Phenomena, vol. 1.  Springer.  Original Russian edition, 1982.
    - Brekhovskikh (1917-2005) was a Soviet-Russian physicist and distinguished acoustician and oceanographer.  The book emphasizes wave phenomena, but not to the exclusion of other topics, such as turbulence and magnetohydrodynamics, which earn their own chapters.  Solutions are provided for selected problems.
    
- Benny Lautrup, 2011:  *Physics of Continuous Matter: Exotic and Everyday Phenomena in the Macroscopic World*, 2d edition. CRC Press.  Original edition, 2005.
    - This massive text by a Danish theoretical physicist is the most comprehensive contemporary introductory book on continuum mechanics by a physicist.  It is aimed at third-year undergraduates or higher.  "Answers" to odd-numbered problems are found in the back, but some are actually just hints while others outline the solution.  A [supporting webpage](https://www.lautrup.nbi.dk/continuousmatter2/index.html) provides addenda, errata, and other apparatus.
   
- Arnold Sommerfeld, 1950:  *Mechanics of Deformable Bodies*, 2d edition.  Translated by G. Kuerti.  Lectures on Theoretical Physics, vol. 2.  Academic Press.  Original German edition, 1943.
    - Sommerfeld (1868-1951) was a distinguished German physicist who made pivotal contributions to both classical and modern physics; four of his doctoral students (Heisenberg, Pauli, Debye, and Bethe) and three of his post-docs (Pauling, Rabi, and von Laue) later won Nobel Prizes.  The coverage of topics in this book is severely limited from a 21st century perspective; for instance, boundary layers are discussed only qualitatively in a few pages.  Answers and comments to problems are provided.  See my further comments on this book at a [companion page](physicscourses.md).
    
- Kip S. Thorne & Roger D. Blandford, 2021:  *Elasticity & Fluid Dynamics*.  Modern Classical Physics, vol. 3.  Princeton University Press.
    - This first-year graduate-level material is also available in the authors' massive parent text, *Modern Classical Physics* (2017), supported by [this website](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691159027/modern-classical-physics).  Thorne, of course, is a 2017 Nobel Laureate in Physics; co-author of the famous general relativity text,  *Gravitation* by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler; and an executive producer for the 2014 film *Interstellar*.  Blandford is a winner of both the Crawfoord and Shaw prizes in astronomy.  See my further comments on this book at a [companion page](physicscourses.md).
    
- James S. Trefil, 1975:  *Introduction to the Physics of Fluids and Solids*.  Pergamon.  Reprinted with corrections by Dover, 2010.
    - While this author is better known as a popular science writer, this book was motivated by his work as a consulting physicist, and realizing that physicists are at a disadvantage for such work if they lack much exposure to continuum mechanics.  As far as I know, this is the only book on this list that discusses the liquid drop model of the nucleus.  Unfortunately this book received a very negative review by Ascher Shapiro in the *Journal of Fluid Mechanics*.
     
### Books covering fluid mechanics

The "standards" on this list are Landau & Lifshitz (1997) and Tritton (1988), both classics but with different personalities.  Landau/Lifshitz is very theoretical, while Tritton is packed with photographs and plots of experimental data.  Neither is likely suitable for a first undergraduate course in the field, but serious students of hydrodynamics will inevitably consult both.

- Thomas E. Faber, 1995:  *Fluid Dynamics for Physicists*. Cambridge University Press.
    - Faber (1927-2004) was both a theoretical and experimental physicist at Cambridge University and also an executive at the publishing company founded by his father.  Like Tritton's, Faber's book is packed with photos, but unlike Tritton, it fails to include much experimental data.  Faber concedes that he is but an "enthusiastic amateur" compared to other physicists who've written fluid dynamics books.  He wrote this one so that it "may be read for pleasure as well as for instruction by physicists of any age and at almost any level of sophisticiation who want to learn fluid dynamics for themselves."  It lacks exercises, but derivations are only sketched, so that readers could certainly work through the material with pencil and paper if they chose to.  

- Gregory Falkovich, 2018:  *Fluid Mechanics*, second edition. Cambridge University Press.  Original edition, 2011, subtitled *A Short Course for Physicists*.
    - Written by an Israeli theoretical physicist, this very short book attempts to teach "the minimum of what every physicist, engineer and mathematician needs to know about hydrodynamics."  Solutions to exercises are provided in the back, and a [supporting website](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/falkovich/fluid-mechanics) is maintained by the author.  This short text is more demanding on the reader than some others on this list.
   
- Richard Fitzpatrick, 2017:  *Theoretical Fluid Mechanics*.  Institute of Physics.
    - Lamenting the absence of fluid dynamics courses in the physics curriculum, the book was written for self-study by graduate students, and consequently includes solutions to all its problems.  Emphasizes astrophysical and geophysical applications.  The author seems to be an astrophysicist-turned-plasma physicist.
    
- Etienne Guyon, Jean-Pierre Hulin, Luc Petit, and Catalin D. Mitescu, 2015:  *Physical Hydrodynamics*, 2d edition.  Oxford University Press.  Original French edition, 1991.
    - This French text is another with a strong experimentalists' flavor.  The original edition had no exercises, but the second edition has a small number of end-of-chapter problems, with solutions in the back.  See Raymond A. Shaw's [review](https://doi.org/10.1119/1.4929153) in the *American Journal of Physics*, 83 (12):  1061-1062 (2015).
    
- Tsutomu Kambe, 2007:  *Elementary Fluid Mechanics*. World Scientific.
    - The author is a Japanese theorist.  The last two chapters, on superfluid and quantized circulation, and gauge theory of ideal fluid flows, respectively, set this book apart from those written by non-physicists.  Solutions are provided for all problems.

- Lev D. Landau and Evgenii M. Lifshitz, 1997:  *Fluid Mechanics*, 2d edition, corrected reprint. Translated by J. B. Skyes and W. H. Reid.  Course of Theoretical Physics, vol. 6.  Butterworth-Heinemann.  Original Russian edition, 1944.
     - Landau (1908-1968) was a Soviet-Azerbaijani theoretical physicist and 1962 Nobel Laureate, who developed this course with Soviet-Ukrainian colleague Lifshitz (1915-1985).  See my further comments on this book at a [companion page](physicscourses.md).

- Percival D. McCormack and Lawrence Crane, 1973:  *Physical Fluid Dynamics*.  Academic Press.  \[Out of print\]
    - Percy McCormack (1929-2015) was an Irish physicist who later became chief of operation medicine for NASA, and still later a bio-engineering professor.  His Irish colleague Lawrence J. Crane (1931-2021) was an applied mathematician.  The final chapter of the book covers superfluid helium, distinguishing it from most other textbooks.  There is also a chapter on particle-laden flows, a topic not treated as extensively by other physicists on this list.  However, Russell J. Donnelly provided a very negative [review](https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1119/1.10051) of this book in the *American Journal of Physics*, and I have not seen it cited much.

- Geoffrey J. Pert, 2013:  *Introductory Fluid Mechanics for Physicists and Mathematicians*. Wiley.

- Ludwig Prandtl, 1952:  *Essentials of Fluid Dynamics, With Applications to Hydraulics, Aeronautics, Meteorology and other Subjects*.  Translated by W. M. Deans.  Hafner.  Original German edition, 1942.  An updated version edited by H. Oertel is published in Springer's *Applied Mathematical Sciences* series (2010).
    - I've included this book by the founder of boundary layer theory, Ludwig Prandtl (1875-1953), mainly because it made T. E. Faber's own list of such books.  However, like Faber, I would not consider it a go-to for a student first learning this subject.  This book grew out of some encyclopedia articles Prandtl wrote in 1913, and morphed multiple times until reaching the form of this book.  It should be noted that Prandtl's actual lectures on fluid mechanics were prepared for publication by O. G. Tietjens in 1934 (McGraw-Hill) and made available as Dover paperbacks in 1957 under the titles *Fundamentals of Hydro- and Aeromechanics* (translated by L. Rosenhead) and *Applied Hydro- and Aeromechanics* (translated by J. P. Den Hartog).

- Sarada G. Rajeev, 2018: *Fluid Mechanics: A Geometrical Point of View*. Oxford University Press.
    - Unusual for its emphasis on dynamical systems, Lie algebra, Riemannian geometry, and the use of the Hamiltonian formulation; also covers numerical computation, chaotic advection, and even renormalization.  This is what happens when a particle theorist writes about hydrodynamics.

- Oded Regev, Orkan M. Umurhan, and Philip A. Yecko, 2016:  *Modern Fluid Dynamics for Physics and Astrophysics*.  Graduate Texts in Physics.  Springer.
    - See the review by astrophysicist Giuseppe Lodato in the May 2017 issue of [Physics Today](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/PT.3.3559).

- Michel Rieutord, 2015:  *Fluid Dynamics: An Introduction*. Graduate Texts in Physics.  Springer.
    - A French astrophysicist's presentation of fluid dynamics; includes chapters on magnetohydrodynamics and kinetic theory.  Provides solutions to exercises.

- David J. Tritton, 1988: *Physical Fluid Dynamics*, 2d edition. Oxford University Press.  (Original edition, 1977.)
    - D. J. Tritton (1935-1998) was trained as an experimental hydrodynamicist, and had broad interests, with particular involvement in geophysics and planetary physics.  This book emphasizes experimental and observational results, along with geophysical applications (not surprisingly), and has a set of problems, hints, and answers in the back.

### Books covering solid mechanics

I am admittedly very unfamiliar with the literature in this field, so this section is especially prone to incompleteness.  (I am grateful to Prof. James Hanna for pointing me to the Green/Zerna and Audoly/Pomeau books.)

- Basile Audoly and Yves Pomeau, 2010:  *Elasticity and Geometry:  From Hair Curls to the Non-Linear Response of Shells*.  Oxford University Press.
- Albert E. Green and Wolfgang Zerna, 2012:  *Theoretical Elasticity*, 2d edition (reprint).  Dover.  Original edition published in 1954 by Oxford University Press.
- Lev D. Landau and Evgenii M Lifshitz, 1986:  *Theory of Elasticity*, 3d ed., revised and enlarged by E. M. Lifshitz, A. M. Kosevich, and L. P. Pitaevskii.  Translated by J. B. Sykes and W. H. Reid.  Course of Theoretical Physics, Vol. 7.  Butterworth-Heinemann.  Original Russian edition, 1944.
- Alister G. McLellan, 1980:  *The Classical Thermodynamics of Deformable Materials*.  Cambridge Monographs on Physics.  Cambridge University Press.
- Adrian P. Sutton, 2020:  *Physics of Elasticity and Crystal Defects*.  Oxford Series on Materials Modelling.  Oxford University Press.

### Books covering acoustics

Despite the relatively few physicists who work in acoustics in recent decades, a surprisingly large number of the key books in the field have been written
by physicists.  Lord Rayleigh's 19th century classic *Theory of Sound* ranks first among these.  (Rayleigh also won the 1904 Nobel Prize in Physics.)  As acoustics deserves a separate page of its own, which is beyond the scope
of my present efforts, I will not attempt to list such books here.  Let it suffice to mention the names of illustrious authors such as Leo Beranek, Eugene Skudrzyk, 
Philip M. Morse and K. Uno Ingard, Allan D. Pierce, David T. Blackstock, and Thomas D. Rossing.  Also worthy of mention is the workhorse text by 
Kinsler/Frey/Coppens/Sanders and the textbook by Berg and Stork.


### Other books by physicists that you should be aware of

As a point of personal privilege, I want to include a few other titles on a more subjective basis.

- Sybren R. DeGroot and Peter Mazur, 1984:  *Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics*.  Dover.  (Original edition published by North-Holland, 1962.)
    - A foundational monograph on the thermodynamics of irreversible processes.  Many authors in the nonequilbrium statistical physics literature cite DeGroot & Mazur as a source for hydrodynamics.  DeGroot (1916-1994) was a Danish theorist, and Mazur (1922-2001) was of Austrian extraction; both worked in the Netherlands.

- Uriel Frisch, 1995:  *Turbulence:  The Legacy of A. N. Kolmogorov*. Cambridge University Press.
    - Several physicists have written books on turbulence, and if your interests turn in this direction, you will get to know them.  However if not, you should still consider acquiring some literacy in the field by reading this exposition, which gives particular attention to Kolmogorov's 1941 scaling theory, "one of the very few exact and nontrivial results in the field".  Indeed I would argue that Kolmogorov's reasoning in his work on turbulence is that of a physicist, rather than of a mathematician.

- Peter Hertel, 2012:  *Continuum Physics*.  Graduate Texts in Physics.  Springer.
    - This compact book includes continuum mechanics and thermodynamics, but ranges well beyond these to discuss other topics in continuum physics, including electromagnetic, thermoelectric and optical phenomena, including photonics.  Coverage has breadth but lacks depth; perhaps its main value is cultural literacy (and perhaps there should be more books like this for physicists).  The book lacks both problems and an index.  Hertel (1938-2017) was a German theoretical physicist.

- Roman Jackiw, 2002:  *Lectures on Fluid Dynamics: A Particle Theorist's View of Supersymmetric, Non-Abelian, Noncommutative Fluid Mechanics and d-Branes*. Springer.
    - Presents a new formulation of hydrodynamics, "an ancient field theory, but which can be enhanced by the ideas that we gleaned from particle physics."  

- Robert Bruce Lindsay, 1960:  *Mechanical Radiation*.  The International Series in Pure and Applied Physics.  McGraw-Hill.  \[Out of print\]
    - Focuses on wave phenomena in various classical media:  strings, membranes, rods, plates, elastic media, incompressible fluids, sound in fluids, and applictions in acoustics and geophysics, oceanography, and meteorology.  The final chapter delves into a range of special topics such as statistical physics, electron "hydrodynamics" in superconductivity, and liquid helium.  Lindsay (1900-1985) was an American theorist particularly active in acoustics.

- Hans J. Lugt, 1983:  *Vortex Flow in Nature and Technology*.  Wiley-Interscience.  (Original German edition, 1979.  English edition reprinted by Krieger, 1995.) \[Out of print\]
    - A surprisingly nontechnical exposition of vortex flow, a central concept in hydrodynamics.  Packed with illustrations, it would make an excellent introduction to hydrodynamics for a student who hasn't yet mastered vector calculus, yet the book can also grip the attention of a seasoned physicist.  This book deserves to be better known in the fluid mechanics community.  Lugt is a German physicist who worked at the U.S. Navy's David Taylor Model Basin.

Finally, having mentioned Lord Rayleigh, Lev Landau, and Kip Thorne above, I can't fail to mention two other Nobel laureates in physics:

- Hannes Alfven and Carl-Gunne Falthammar, 1963: *Cosmical Electrodynamics*, 2d edition. International Series of Monographs on Physics.  Oxford University Press.  (Original edition, 1950.)
    - Alfven (1908-1995) is the founder of modern magnetohydrodynamics, a topic he covers in this book.  Alven won the 1970 Nobel Prize in Physics.

- Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, 1981:  *Hydrodynamic and Hydromagnetic Stability*.  Dover.  (Original edition published in the International Series of Monographs on Physics, by Oxford University Press, 1961.)
    - A landmark contribution by a legendary astrophysicist.  Anyone interested in hydrodynamic instabilities must own this book.  Chandrasekhar (1910-1995) won the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics.  (In 2011 Edward A. Spiegel  edited and published Chandrasekhar's 1954 lectures on *The Theory of Turbulence*.)

### Some reflections on the books discussed

In this section I focus on the books listed in the first two sections, on continuum and fluid mechanics.  

#### A chronological perspective  

In the early years of the nuclear age, Sommerfeld's lectures appeared in English in 1950, and Prandtl's book in 1952, both near the end of their authors' lives.  The first English edition of Landau & Lifshitz appeared in 1959.  All three of these books have roots in the pre-WWII period.  Sommerfeld and Landau/Lifshitz remained staples for years; though most of the books in fluid mechanics in this era were written by nonphysicists, such as Batchelor's masterpiece (1967).  It was not until the 1970s that a few more physicists realized that their perspective could be useful - McCormack & Crane (1973), Trefil (1975), and Tritton (1977).  It seems that only the third of these was an undisputed success.  The 1980s saw the appearance of Bhatia & Singh (1984), the first English edition of Brekhovskikh & Goncharov (1985), and  second editions of the classics, Landau & Lifshitz (1987) and Tritton (1988).  The 1990s greeted the second edition of Brekhovskikh & Goncharov (1994) and the landmark contribution of Faber (1995).  Faber claimed to know of only three previous fluid dynamics books written by physicists:  Ludwig Prandtl's *Essentials of Fluid Dynamics* and the classics by Landau/Lifshitz and Tritton -- basically snubbing the other authors mentioned in this paragraph -- including Arnold Sommerfeld!

The first decade of the 21st century witnessed the first English edition of Guyon et al. (2001), the first edition of Lautrup (2005), and Kambe's contribution (2007).  However the second decade welcomed an outburst of physicists on our subject:  Falkovich (2011, 2018), Pert (2013), Rieutord (2015), Regev et al. (2016), Fitzpatrick (2017), Thorne & Blandford (2017), Rajeev (2018), as well as second editions of Lautrup (2011) and Guyon et al (2015).  Thus, the most recent decade has single-handedly eliminated the death of general and introductory books on fluid mechanics written by physicists!

#### A topical perspective

Now let's visit a few topics that may be of special interest to physicists.

*Kinetic theory of gases*.  It is possible to derive the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations as approximations from the Boltzmann transport equation, but this is a topic at best only alluded to in books on this list.  Most writers seem to think the topic belongs to a statistical physics text rather than a fluid mechanics one, and they do have a point.  Sommerfeld covers it in *Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics* (though that particular section was written by the editors after his death) and Landau/Lifshitz covers it in *Physical Kinetics* (again, prepared after Landau's death by Lifshitz and Pitaevskii).  The only book on this list that includes a chapter on this topic is Rieutord.  Readers are likely to find this topic better covered in more specialized works on plasma physics and astrophysical plasmas.

*Magnetohydrodynamics*.  This topic is well covered in plasma physics texts, and there is an entire genre of books on astrophysical hydrodynamics that deal with MHD too.  Landau/Lifshitz cover it in their *Electrodynamics of Continuious Media* rather than in *Fluid Mechanics*.  However, it's often good to give physics students studying fluids an introduction to the topic.  Astrophysicists Rieutord and Thorne/Blandford devote entire chapters to MHD, as do Brekhovskikh & Goncharov, and Regev et al.  Meanwhile Faber and Guyon et al. devote only a section of a chapter to the topic, but at least it's included.

*Superfluid hydrodynamics*.  This is an arena where frictionless flow can actually be realized; phenomena such as the "fountain effect", "second sound", and circulation quantization (line vortices) can be studied.  A number of Nobel laureates in physics have contributed to these studies.  However, even among fluid dynamics books by physicists, this topic is rarely covered.  Only Landau/Lifshitz, McCormack/Crane, and Kambe have entire chapters on this subject; Guyon et al. include a very brief appendix (7A).  Trefil and Thorne/Blandford deal with superfluid helium only in the exercises, using the two-fluid model. 

Landau, of course, is a primary contributor to the theory of superfluidity, and he (and independently, L. Tisza) proposed the two-fluid model.  Landau/Lifshitz's *Fluid Mechanics* covers the macroscopic theory (Ch. 16), while their *Statistical Physics*, Part 2 (Ch. 3), covers the microscopic theory.  Kambe discusses the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and differences between dilute alkali atom superfluids and liquid helium.  However, in my opinion coverage in the books on this list only serves to provide some cultural literacy to the reader on this topic, which may be covered in greater depth in an advanced statistical physics or condensed matter course.

*Relativistic fluids*.  This topic is even less popular among the books on this list.  Only Landau/Lifshitz have a whole chapter (15) for it, and most others on this list fail to even bring it up.  Not surprisingingly, Thorne/Blandford give their readers a taste of ideal relativistic hydrodynamics, referring them to MTW's *Gravitation* for relativistic viscous hydrodynamics.

*Non-Newtonian fluids*.  This is a topic surprisingly mentioned at best in passing by most books on this list.  Only Faber devotes an entire chapter (10) to the topic, though he includes plasmas and superfluid helium in the same chapter.  Guyon et al (Sec. 4.4) and Rieutord (Sec. 1.9) do provide some coverage, as do McCormack & Crane (Sec. 1.5), though their section is considerably briefer than the others mentioned here.
