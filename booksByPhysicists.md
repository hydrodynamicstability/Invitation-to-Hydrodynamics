## Books on fluid and continuum mechanics written by physicists

I have listed all the books on continuum, fluid, and solid mechanics written by physicists (or astronomers) of an introductory or general nature that I know of.
I've confined the scope of this list to include works published after the Second World War and available in the English language.  I have not included
more specialized works on continuum mechanics for geophysics, atmospheric dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, plasma physics, astrophysical hydrodynamics, microhydrodynamics, and so on. 
Some elements of elasticity theory typically appear in texts on solid state physics, while elements of hydrodynamics less commonly appear in condensed matter physics texts -- these too will be omitted here.  Finally, hydrodynamics is often a canonical example of nonequilibrium thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, and I have not listed books in these fields that provide extensive coverage of this connection, with the exception of the classic by DeGroot & Mazur. The reason for these omissions is that such works often fail to provide a general view of hydrodynamics, to include for instance the topic of aerodynamic lift.  (Any physicist who finds Bernoulli's equation applied to cambered airfoils a satisfactory explanation of aerodynamic lift needs to explain how aerobatic aircraft can fly upside down!)

This list is surely not complete, but I would like to make it so.  If you believe you know of an omission, please contact me at (remove spaces) c t o n g "at" m a i l a p s . o r g.

Commentary on these books is forthcoming.

- Leonid M. Brekhovskikh and Valery Goncharov, 1994:  *Mechanics of Continua and Wave Dynamics*, 2d edition.  Translated by V. Vavilova.  Springer Series on Wave Phenomena, vol. 1.  Springer.
    - The first author was a Soviet physicist and distinguished acoustician.  The book emphasizes wave phenomena, but not to the exclusion of other topics.  Solutions are provided for selected problems.
- Peter Hertel, 2012:  *Continuum Physics*.  Graduate Texts in Physics.  Springer.
    - This compact book includes continuum mechanics and thermodynamics, but ranges well beyond these to discuss other topics in continuum physics, including electromagnetic, thermoelecric and optical phenomena, including photonics.  Unfortunately the book lacks both problems and an index.
- Benny Lautrup, 2011:  *Physics of Continuous Matter: Exotic and Everyday Phenomena in the Macroscopic World*, 2d edition. CRC Press.
    - This massive text is the most comprehensive contemporary introductory book on continuum mechanics by a physicist.  It is aimed at third-year undergraduates or higher.  "Answers" to odd-numbered problems are found in the back, but some are actually just hints while others outline the solution.
- Arnold Sommerfeld, 1950:  *Mechanics of Deformable Bodies*, 2d edition.  Translated by G. Kuerti.  Lectures on Theoretical Physics, vol. 2.  Academic Press.  \[Out of print\]
    - The author was a distinguished physicist who made pivotal contributions to both classical and modern physics; four of his doctoral students and three of his post-docs later won Nobel Prizes.
- Kip S. Thorne & Roger D. Blandford, 2021:  *Elasticity & Fluid Dynamics*.  Modern Classical Physics, vol. 3.  Princeton University Press.
    - The material is also available in the authors' massive parent text, *Modern Classical Physics* (2014).  Thorne, of course, is a 2017 Nobel Laureate in Physics; co-author of the famous general relativity text,  *Gravitation* by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler; and an executive producer for the 2014 film *Interstellar*.
- James S. Trefil, 1975:  *Introduction to the Physics of Fluids and Solids*.  Pergamon.  Reprinted with corrections by Dover, 2010.
    - While this author is better known as a popular science writer, this book was motivated by his work as a consulting physicist, and realizing that physicists are at a disadvantage for such work if they lack much exposure to continuum mechanics.
     
### Books covering fluid mechanics

The "standards" on this list are Landau & Lifshitz (1997) and Tritton (1988), both classics but with different personalities.  Landau/Lifshitz is very theoretical, while Tritton is packed with photographs and plots of experimental data.  Neither is likely suitable for a first undergraduate course in the field, but serious students of hydrodynamics will inevitably consult both.

- Thomas E. Faber, 1995:  *Fluid Dynamics for Physicists*. Cambridge University Press.
- Gregory Falkovich, 2018:  *Fluid Mechanics: A Short Course for Physicists*, second edition. Cambridge University Press.
- Richard Fitzpatrick, 2017:  *Theoretical Fluid Mechanics*.  Institute of Physics.
    - Lamenting the absence of fluid dynamics courses in the physics curriculum, the book was written for self-study, and consequently includes solutions to all its problems.  Emphasizes astrophysical and geophysical applications.  
- Etienne Guyon, Jean-Pierre Hulin, Luc Petit, and Catalin D. Mitescu, 2015:  *Physical Hydrodynamics*, 2d edition.  Oxford University Press.
- Tsutomu Kambe, 2007:  *Elementary Fluid Mechanics*. World Scientific.
- Lev D. Landau and Evgenii M. Lifshitz, 1997:  *Fluid Mechanics*, 2d edition, corrected reprint. Translated by J. B. Skyes and W. H. Reid.  Course of Theoretical Physics, vol. 6.  Butterworth-Heinemann.
- P. D. McCormack and Lawrence Crane, 1973:  *Physical Fluid Dynamics*.  Academic Press.  \[Out of print\]
- Geoffrey J. Pert, 2013:  *Introductory Fluid Mechanics for Physicists and Mathematicians*. Wiley.
- Sarada G. Rajeev, 2018: *Fluid Mechanics: A Geometrical Point of View*. Oxford University Press.
    - Unusual for its emphasis on dynamical systems, Lie algebra, Riemannian geometry, and the use of the Hamiltonian formulation; also covers numerical computation, chaotic advection, and even renormalization.  This is what happens when a particle theorist writes about hydrodynamics.
- Oded Regev, Orkan M. Umurhan, and Philip A. Yecko, 2016:  *Modern Fluid Dynaics for Physics and Astrophysics*.  Graduate Texts in Physics.  Springer.
- Michel Rieutord, 2015:  *Fluid Dynamics: An Introduction*. Graduate Texts in Physics.  Springer.
    - A French astrophysicist's presentation of fluid dynamics; includes chapters on magnetohydrodynamics and kinetic theory.  Provides solutions to exercises.
- David J. Tritton, 1988: *Physical Fluid Dynamics*, 2d edition. Oxford University Press.

### Books covering solid mechanics

I am admittedly very unfamiliar with the literature in this field, so this section is especially prone to incompleteness.

- Lev D. Landau and Evgenii M Lifshitz, 1986:  *Theory of Elasticity*, 3d ed., revised and enlarged by E. M. Lifshitz, A. M. Kosevich, and L. P. Pitaevskii.  Translated by J. B. Sykes and W. H. Reid.  Course of Theoretical Physics, Vol. 7.  Butterworth-Heinemann.
- Alister G. McLellan, 1980:  *The Classical Thermodynamics of Deformable Materials*.  Cambridge Monographs on Physics.  Cambridge University Press.
- Adrian P. Sutton, 2020:  *Physics of Elasticity and Crystal Defects*.  Oxford Series on Materials Modelling.  Oxford University Press.

### Books covering acoustics

Despite the relatively few physicists who work in acoustics in recent decades, a surprisingly large number of the key books in the field have been written
by physicists.  Lord Rayleigh's classic *Theory of Sound* ranks first among these.  As this topic deserves a separate page of its own, which is beyond the scope
of my present efforts, I will not attempt to list such books here.  Let it suffice to mention the names of illustrious authors such as Leo Beranek, Eugene Skudrzyk, 
Philip M. Morse and K. Uno Ingard, Allen D. Pierce, David T. Blackstock, and Thomas D. Rossing.  Also worthy of mention is the workhorse text by 
Kinsler/Frey/Coppens/Sanders and the textbook by Berg and Stork.


### Other books by physicists that you should be aware of

As a point of personal privilege, I want to include a few other titles on a more subjective basis.

- Sybren R. DeGroot and Peter Mazur, 1984:  *Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics*.  Dover.  (Original edition published by North-Holland, 1962.)
    - A foundational monograph on the thermodynamics of irreversible processes.  Many books in the nonequilbrium statistical physics literature cite DeGroot & Mazur as a source for hydrodynamics.
- Uriel Frisch, 1995:  *Turbulence:  The Legacy of A. N. Kolmogorov*. Cambridge University Press.
    - Several physicists have written books on turbulence, and if your interests turn in this direction, you will get to know them.  However if not, you should still consider acquiring some literacy in the field by reading this exposition, which gives particular attention to Kolmogorov's 1941 scaling theory, "one of the very few exact and nontrivial results in the field".  
- Roman Jackiw, 2002:  *Lectures on Fluid Dynamics: A Particle Theorist's View of Supersymmetric, Non-Abelian, Noncommutative Fluid Mechanics and d-Branes*. Springer.
    - Presents a new formulation of hydrodynamics, "an ancient field theory, but which can be enhanced by the ideas that we gleaned from particle physics."  
- Robert Bruce Lindsay, 1960:  *Mechanical Radiation*.  The International Series in Pure and Applied Physics.  McGraw-Hill.  \[Out of print\]
    - Focuses on wave phenomena in various classical media:  strings, membranes, rods, plates, elastic media, incompressible fluids, sound in fluids, and applictions in acoustics and geophysics, oceanography, and meteorology.  The final chapter delves into a range of special topics such as statistical physics, electron "hydrodynamics" in superconductivity, and liquid helium.
- Hans J. Lugt, 1983:  *Vortex Flow in Nature and Technology*.  Wiley-Interscience.  (Original German edition, 1979.  English edition reprinted by Krieger, 1995.) \[Out of print\]
    - A surprisingly nontechnical exposition of vortex flow, a central concept in hydrodynamics.  Packed with illustrations, it would make an excellent introduction to hydrodynamics for a student who hasn't yet mastered vector calculus, yet the book can also grip the attention of a seasoned physicist.  This book deserves to be better known in the fluid mechanics community.

Finally, having mentioned Lord Rayleigh, Lev Landau, and Kip Thorne above, fluid mechanics books by two more Nobel laureates in physics are worthy of note:

- Hannes Alfven and Carl-Gunne Falthammar, 1963: *Cosmical Electrodynamics*, 2d edition. International Series of Monographs on Physics.  Oxford University Press.  (Original edition, 1950.)
    - Alfven is the founder of modern magnetohydrodynamics, a topic he covers in this book.
- Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, 1981:  *Hydrodynamic and Hydromagnetic Stability*.  Dover.  (Original edition published in the International Series of Monographs on Physics, by Oxford University Press, 1961.)
    - A landmark contribution by a legendary astrophysicist.  Anyone interested in hydrodynamic instabilities must own this book.  (In 2011 Edward A. Spiegel  edited and published Chandrasekhar's 1954 lectures on *The Theory of Turbulence*.)
