## An Encomium for *D/Dt* Notation

In this panegyric, I discuss Sir George Gabriel Stokes' *D/Dt* notation for the material derivative, and defend it against Nobel-Prize wielding arrivistes.
I have included excerpts from several key texts, and I apologize for the poor quality of the scans.

### The Material Derivative

One of any student's first lessons in fluid dynamics is the use, in D'Alembert-Euler local field theory, of a total derivative known as the *material derivative*,
*convective derivative*, or *substantive derivative*.  For instance the classic monograph by Lamb (1932, sec. 5) includes the following.

Lamb used the *D/Dt* notation introduced by Stokes himself (1849, Sec. 5).  Other authors use either *d/dt* or *D/Dt* for this concept.  Batchelor (1967, sec. 2.1), for instance, has this passage.

Tritton (1988) has an entire section (5.5) dedicated to the "substantive derivative", which I won't quote here; he also uses *D/Dt* notation for it.  The *Feynman Lectures* has a nice derivation of the expression in [Chapter 40](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_40.html), which you can read for free, but he does not use any special notation for the material derivative.
