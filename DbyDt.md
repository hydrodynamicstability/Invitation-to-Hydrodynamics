## An Encomium for D/Dt Notation

In this panegyric, I discuss Sir George Gabriel Stokes' D/Dt notation for the material derivative, and defend it against Nobel-Prize wielding arrivistes.
I have included excerpts from several key texts, and I apologize for the poor quality of the scans.

### The Material Derivative

One of any student's first lessons in fluid dynamics is the use, in D'Alembert-Euler local field theory, of a total derivative known as the *material derivative*,
*convective derivative*, or *substantive derivative*.  For instance the classic Lamb (1932) includes the following.
