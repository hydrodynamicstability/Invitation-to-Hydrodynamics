## An Encomium for *D/Dt* Notation

In this panegyric, I discuss Sir George Gabriel Stokes' *D/Dt* notation for the material derivative, and defend it against Nobel-Prize wielding arrivistes.  Of course, disagreements about notation are among the most pointless in science, so please regard this essay for its entertainment value only.  I have included excerpts from several key texts, and I apologize for the poor quality of the scans.

### The Material Derivative

One of any student's first lessons in fluid dynamics is the use, in D'Alembert-Euler local field theory, of a total derivative known as the *material derivative*,
*convective derivative*, or *substantive derivative*.  For instance the classic monograph by Sir Horace Lamb (1932, sec. 5) includes the following.

Lamb used the *D/Dt* notation introduced by Stokes himself (1849, Sec. 5).  Other authors use either *d/dt* or *D/Dt* for this concept.  Batchelor (1967, sec. 2.1), for instance, has this passage.

Tritton (1988) has an entire section (5.5) dedicated to the "substantive derivative", which I won't quote here; he also uses *D/Dt* notation for it.  The *Feynman Lectures* have a nice derivation of the expression in [Chapter 40](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_40.html), which you can read for free, but Feynman does not use any special notation for the material derivative.

A particularly insightful passage on this notation is provided by Sir James Lighthill, who like Stokes, was a holder of Sir Issac Newton's Lucasian Chair of Mathematics at Cambridge University.  Lighthill (1986, Sec. 3.1) writes:

Here Lighthill defends the use of *D/Dt* rather than *d/dt* for this use in fluid dynamics.  However, many key writers, including Landau & Lifshitz (1959), continue to use *d/dt* instead of *D/Dt*.

Kip Thorne and Roger Blandford, in their *Modern Classical Physics* (2017), also use *d/dt* for the material derivative, but go one step further.  See this excerpt from Sec. 14.2.1:

They go on to use the term "fluid derivative" for their expression 14.5 when acting on a vector (and when acting on a scalar, they state is it just the convective derivative).  Finally they parenthetically (and dismissively) note that "The notation *D/Dt* is used in some older texts for the convective derivative *d/dt*."  Excuse me?  I have never seen any other text use *D/Dt* for expression 14.5.  Thorne and Blandford have appropriated Stokes' notation for an expression other than what Stokes (and generations of authors after him) intended.

### Appendix:  Stokes himself

This is an excerpt from Stokes (1949) where *D/Dt* first appears.
