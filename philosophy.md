## Some Philosophy of Fluid Mechanics

- "Hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics are fundamental, regardless of popular opinion."

  - Eugene N. Parker (1927-2022)

  - Quoted in the retrospective by Stuart D. Bale, *Science*, 376: 461 (29 Apr 2022).

- "The leitmotif, the ever recurring melody, is that two things are indispensable in any reasoning, in any description we shape of a segment of reality: to submit to experience and to face the language that is used, with unceasing logical criticism."

  - Richard von Mises (1883-1953)
    
  - *Mathematical Theory of Compressible Fluid Flow* (New York: Academic Press, 1958; reprinted by Dover, 2004), epigraph.

- "To begin with, we should bear in mind the inherent limitations of all mathematical analyses of physical events.  First, although our aim is to formulate general rules of conduct for fluid in motion, it is the fluid itself and not our analysis which finally
decides whether it will conform to those rules; the justification of an analysis, therefore, lies not in its apparent rigour nor in its elegance--though these things count for much--but in its agreement with practical observations.  Next, such analysis can
account only for those properties of a physical event whose existence our limited knowledge can conceive and which we may hope to observe and measure; its value will depend on the discernment with which we single out certain properties for special attention and
on their natural significance.  Last, the claim has never been made that the equations, which we construct to express the mutual dependence of these properties, exactly represent physical fact, and that any deviations from observed fact are due to defects in
the observations; nor, on the other hand, can the infallibility which we thus deny to theory be claimed by experimental observation."

- "Fluid dynamics, including mechanics of liquids and gases, is a part of physics.  We can divide the processes of any physical theory into four steps:
    1.  Placing observed data into general physical laws, assuming the uniformity of nature.
    2.  Transferring the physical laws into mathematical form, thus obtaining a logically consistent system of axioms which usually consists of a system of differential equations.
    3.  Drawing conclusions from these differential equations.  This is a purely mathematical step.
    4.  Check on the results obtained in (3) by experiments.
  
  "It is often assumed that the first two steps are completed for all branches of mechanics and that, therefore, mechanics at present offers only mathematical difficulties.  This, however, is not so for certain facts in fluid dynamics (and elsewhere).

  "The first two steps above have been carried out, as far as fluids are concerned, in two forms.  First a theory of 'perfect fluids' has been developed, and then it was supplemented by a theory of 'viscous fluids'.  However, these
  theories do not explain all the known facts in fluid dynamics.  They cover the explanation of so-called *laminar* flow.  Here the particles travel along smooth curves, or the jet emanating from the opening of a tank.  On the other
  hand, motion in larger channels, like a river, may look smooth as a whole, but each particle by itself has a complicated irregular motion.  It fluctuates violently and may exhibit chaotic behavior.  Such a motion is called *turbulent*.

  "We may say that the first two steps of the physical investigation have been completed for laminar motion; the theory of perfect fluids was given by Euler about 1760, that for viscous fluids by Navier and by Stokes about 1850.  In both cases, we have
  a definite system of partial differential equations.  Now the third step consists of the solution of certain boundary value problems of these partial differential equations.  This mathematical investigation is still going on.  However, in the case of
  turbulent motion hardly the first step has been completed.  Some general rules have been derived, but at present there is no complete and consistent set of axioms (principal equations) which would explain all particular problems of turbulent motion."

  - Richard von Mises (1883-1953) and Kurt O. Friedrichs (1901-1982)

In the spirit of "unceasing logical criticism", may I add that the above account by two mathematicians is grossly oversimplified to the point of mockery; a much-needed alternative perspective is given by an experimental physicist below.

- "One believes that the basic physical laws governing the behaviour of fluids in motion are the usual well-known laws of mechanics--essentially conservation of mass and Newton's laws of motion, together with, for some problems, the laws of thermodynamics.
The complexities arise in the consequences of these laws.  The way in which observed flow patterns do derive from the governing laws is often by no means apparent.  A large theoretical and conceptual structure, built, on the one hand, on the basic laws and, on
the other hand, on experimental observations, is needed to make the connection....

  "Thus, for the most part, fluid dynamical problems are concerned with the behaviour, subject to known laws, of a fluid of specified properties in a specified configuration....Ideally one would like to be able to solve such problems through an appropriate mathematical formulation of the governing laws; the role of experiment would be to check that solutions so obtained do correspond to reality.  In fact the mathematical difficulties are such that a formal theory often has to be supplemented or replaced by experimental observations
and measurements.  Even in cases where a fairly full mathematical description of a flow has been obtained, this has often been possible only after experiments have indicated the type of theory needed.  The subject involves an interplay between theory and experiment.
The proportion each contributes to our understanding of flow behaviour varies greatly from topic to topic."

Finally, I soundly reject the account given by one of the founders of theoretical hydrodynamics, as expressed below:

- "From a single experiment on the pressure of fluids, we derive all the laws of their equilibrium and their movement."

  - Jean le Rond D'Alembert (1717-1783)
