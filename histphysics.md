## Fluid Mechanics and the History of Physics

"A fluid is any body whose parts yield to any force applied to it and yielding are moved easily with respect to one another."  

&emsp; -- Sir Isaac Newton, *Principia Mathematica*, Book 2, Section 5.

"A fluid is a body the contiguous parts of which act on one another with a pressure which is perpendicular to the interface which separates those parts....A great many substances may be found which perfectly fulfil this definition of a fluid when they are at rest, and they are therefore called fluids.  But no existing fluid fulfils the definition when it is in motion.  In a fluid in motion the pressures at a point may be greater in one direction than in another, or, what is the same thing, the force between two parts may not be perpendicular to the interface which separates those parts.  If a fluid could be found which fulfilled the defintion when in motion as well as when at rest, it would be called a Perfect Fluid.  All actual fluids are imperfect, and exhibit the phenomenon of internal friction or viscosity, by which their motion after being stirred about in a vessel is gradually stopped, and the energy of the motion is converted into heat."

&emsp; -- James Clerk Maxwell. *Theory of Heat*, 2d edition (Longmans, Green, 1888).

"Now I think hydrodynamics is to be the root of all physical science, and is at present second to none in the beauty of its mathematics."

&emsp; -- William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), letter to Sir George Gabriel Stokes, 20 Dec 1857.

### Introduction

Most physicists attribute the beginning of *field theory* to Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell in the 19th century.  It is true that theirs was the first *force field theory*; however it borrows a great deal of its mathematics from *mechanical* field theories that originated in the 18th century with Leonhard Euler and other Enlightenment savants.  Consequently much of the vector calculus of electromagnetism retains a distinctly hydrodynamic character, as illustrated in this [video lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB4C3YfSZyU&list=PL8_xPU5epJddRABXqJ5h5G0dk-XGtA5cZ&index=36) from *The Mechanical Universe and Beyond*, by Prof. David Goodstein (Caltech).

The greatest classical physicists of all time, Galileo, Newton, Faraday, and Maxwell, all investigated fluid mechanics, though their primary influence on the subject is indirect, through their laying of the foundations of classical mechanics, electromagnetism, and kinetic theory.  At least two of the principal founders of classical thermodynamics, Helmholtz and Kelvin, made more direct and profound contributions to hydrodynamics.  Albert Einstein's foray into aerodynamics is more questionable.  Finally, while only one Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded for classical hydrodynamics (Hannes Alfven, 1970), many have been awarded to work in superfluids, and many Nobel Laureates honored for other fields have been involved in a greater or lesser extent in the physics of fluids.  (For the latter, please see the *Appendix* at the bottom of this page.)

### Galileo

Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) wrote a *Discourse on Floating Bodies* (1612), controversial at the time for its quarrelsome, pro-Archimedian, anti-Aristotelian arguments, but is mostly forgotten today.  Stillman Drake believes this obscurity is undeserved, for "The *Discourse* is distinguished among other works of its time by its repeated recourse to observational and experimental data in opposition to philosophical doctrines.  Moreover, the experiments proposed require no elaborate equipment and no technique beyond reasonable patience and care."  However Galileo's account of air resistance encountered by a pendulum, in his *Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences* (1638), was challenged almost immediately by Marin Mersenne's experimental results.  Galileo claimed that air resistance was directly proportional to both the speed of the moving object and the density of the fluid medium; today the former is considered incorrect, though tha latter is considered correct.  In this connection, later writers speculate that Galileo reported on air resistance experiments that he never actually did.

### Newton

Sir Isaac Newton's (1642-1727) *Principia Mathematica* (1687) is divided into three books.  Most of Book 2 is on fluid mechanics, and Clifford Truesdell famously described the material as "almost entirely original" though "much of it is false".  For example, Newton was the first ever to publish an estimate of the speed of sound in air, but he could not reconcile his prediction with later experimental measurements.  (Laplace later showed that Newton neglected to account for heat variations.) However Book 2 does contain enduring contributions, and *Newtonian fluids* are named in its author's honor.

### The 18th Century

Modern hydrodynamic theory was founded in this era by the Swiss savants, Daniel Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler (see *Notes on the History of Fluid Mechanics* at the end of this page).

It is notable that the Italian physicist, Laura Bassi (1711-1778), who was modern Europe's second female recipient of a doctoral degree, first female science faculty member, and first female science department chair, all at the University of Bologna, was a hydrodynamicist.  While she is better known for promoting Newtonian mechanics and Franklinian electricity in Italy, and for her experimental work on electricity, one of her few surviving publications is on fluid mechanics.  Is she, then, the first woman hydrodynamicist?

- Laura Bassi, 1757:  De problemate quodam hydrometrico.  *De Bononiensi Scientiarum et Artium Instituto atque Academia Commentarii*, IV:  61-73.

At the end of the century (1800), Charles-Augustin de Coloumb (1736-1806), better known for his electrostatic force law, published a series of measurements of viscosity using a torsion wire device.

### Faraday

According to Peter A. Davidson, Michael Faraday (1791-1867) "tried to measure the voltage induced by the Thames flowing through the Earth's magnetic field", allegedly the "first experiment" in magnetohydrodynamics.  After 3 days of effort at the Waterloo bridge, "I could not...obtain any satisfactory results."  (An illustration of this experiment may be found [here](https://nyheritage.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p16694coll20/id/327/).)

- Michael Faraday, 1832:  The Bakerian Lecture--Experimental Researches in Electricity--Second Series.  *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London*, 122:  163-194.

### Maxwell (and Boltzmann)

Keith Moffatt writes of James Clerk Maxwell's (1831-1879) research in hydrodynamics:  "his publications were few but nevertheless ground-breaking in their originality".  Of course, as mentioned, the conceptual and mathematical appartus of hydrodynamic theory was employed by Maxwell in the early stages of developing his electromagnetic field theory.  Meanwhile, after Maxwell's first paper on the kinetic theory of gases, he and his wife Katherine carried out a series of experiments to measure the viscosity of air at various conditions, confirming that it is independent of pressure.  Elizabeth Garber says that these experiments, published in 1866, "became one of the most significant pieces of evidence in favour of his kinetic theory".  Maxwell's second paper on kinetic theory (1867) shows how the Navier-Stokes equations may be obtained within the theory.  Ludwig Boltzmann (1844-1906), of course, completed Maxwell's kinetic theory, also making the connection with the macroscopic Navier-Stokes equations (*Lectures on Gas Theory*, Part I, Secs. 20 & 22).  A cryptic passage in Serrin (1958) claims that Boltzmann was the first to propose that the symmetry of the Cauchy stress tensor be an axiom, rather than a theorem (as Cauchy had presented it).  As Hershel Markovitz (1977) reminds us, Boltzmann (along with Maxwell and Kelvin) contributed to early theories of viscoelasticity, one of the simplest examples of a non-Newtonian fluid.

- L. Boltzmann, 1896 & 1898:  *Vorlesungen uber Gastheorie*, Parts I and II.  J. A. Barth.

### Helmholtz and Kelvin

Of course, two of the 19th century's greatest thermodynamicists were also among its greatest hydrodynamicists:  Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894) and William Thomson (Lord Kelvin, 1824-1907).  They contributed fundamental work to both fields (and Kelvin, in addition, to electromagnetism).  To mention just a few examples in hydrodynamics:  Helmholtz's vortex theorems and Kelvin's circulation theorem are fundamental for inviscid flows; the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is named after them both.  Helmholtz was the first to define vorticity, and also made contributions to acoustics.  Helmholtz's 1868 work on using conformal mapping to study discontinuous two-dimensional flow was picked up and used by others including Gustav Robert Kirchoff (1824-1887) and John William Strutt, Lord Rayleigh (1842-1919).  Kelvin made major contributions to the theory of hydrodynamic waves of various types, but famously refused to beleive that powered flight was possible.

### Einstein's folly

Using a fallacious argument based on the Venturi effect, Albert Einstein (1879-1955) proposes a "cat's back" airfoil design in 1916 that failed miserably when tested by a Berlin aircraft company.  The test pilot, Paul Ehrhardt, survived, but years later, a few months before Einstein died, he told Ehrhardt "I have often been ashamed of my folly of those days."  (A second test pilot, Otto Reichert, crashed but survived.)  "Einstein's folly" is discussed by Bloor (2011, pp. 296-302) and Calaprice et al. (2015, p. 297).  Bloor writes that "Einstein had little knowledge of current developments in the field of aerodynamics.  This episode is a salutory reminder of the difference between fundamental physics and technical mechanics.  Eminence in the former does not guarantee competence in the latter."

### Notes on the history of fluid mechanics

Archimdedes (287-212 BC) formulated the principles of buoyancy and hydrostatics, an enduring contribution from the classical world.  During the Renaissance, Leonardo Da Vinci (1452-1519) correctly formulated the hydraulic continuity equation (but did not publish it) and made extensive studies of fluid flow (e.g., *Del Moto e Misura Dell'Acqua*, posthumously compiled from DaVinci's writings).  The hydraulic continuity equation was rediscovered by Galileo's student, Benedetto Castelli.  Evangelista Torricelli (1608-1647), Blaise Pascal (1623-1662), and Robert Boyle (1627-1691) are known for introducing and elaborating the concept of fluid pressure, including its measurement (Torricelli's barometer), Pascal's Principle, and Boyle's law.

The modern theory of hydrodynamics, and the kinetic theory of gases, were both founded by Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1783) with his publication of *Hydrodynamica* (1738).  This event provoked his jealous father Johann to publish *Hydraulica* (1743), backdating it to appear to have preceded his son's work.  In 1752, Jean le Rond D'Alembert (1717-1783) formulated the modern mass balance law for incompressible flow, an in 1768 his famous paradox on fluid resistance. Bernoulli's Swiss compatriot Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) introduced the momentum balance equation that bears his name in 1755.  These efforts (especially Euler's) represent the formulation of hydrodynamics as a local field theory, governed by coupled, nonlinear partial differential equations, and analyzed using vector (and tensor) calculus.  This formulation serves as a model for later field theories in physics (beginning explicitly with Maxwell's electromagnetic theory).  Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736-1813) extended this work, introducting both the velocity potential and the streamfunction, and used D'Alembert's 1749 complex variable formulation of two-dimensional flow to introduce conformal mapping methods, later exploited by Helmholtz and others.

The 19th century saw the introduction of Augustin-Louis Cauchy's (1789-1857) stress principle (1827) and general equation of motion for continua (1828). The Navier-Stokes equations were developed by multiple individuals (see Darrigol, 2002): the first was in 1822 by Claude Louis Marie Henri Navier (1785-1836), and the last and most definitive was in 1845 by Sir George Gabriel Stokes (1819-1903).  (In between, Darrigol tells us, were Cauchy, Simeon-Denis Poisson, and A. J. C. Barre de Saint-Venant.)  Joseph Fourier (1768-1830) introduced his law of heat conductivity in 1822, and Adolf Fick (1829-1901) introduced his diffusion law in 1855.  Giorgio Bidone (1781-1839) initiated the study of hydraulic jumps in papers of 1820 and 1826, a problem that engaged several later theorists including Gaspard Gustave de Coriolis (1792-1843) in 1836. John Scott Russell (1808-1882) discovered solitary waves during studies for a canal company in the 1830s and 40s.  Osborne Reynolds (1832-1912) began the modern investigation of turbulent flow in 1883.  Andrei N. Kolmogorov (1903-1987) and Alexander M. Obukhov (1918-1989) indepdently proposed turbulence scaling laws in 1941 that have had an enduring influence on the subject; as noted below, Heisenberg and von Weiszacker, and Lars Onsager, developed similar theories after the war.

Ludwig Prandtl (1875-1953) introduced the boundary layer concept in 1904.  The two-dimensional theory of aerodynamic lift was formulated by Wilhelm Kutta (1867-1944) and Nikolai Egorovich Zhukovskii (1847-1921), while the three-dimensional theory is due to Prandtl and Frederick W. Lanchester (1868-1946).  G. I. Taylor (1886-1975), who made enduring contributions across fluid and solid mechanics (such as investigating the Taylor-Couette instability) and aerodynamicist Theodore von Karman (1881-1963), together with Prandtl, are the three most consequential hydrodynamicists of the 20th century.

For more on the history of fluid mechanics, Rouse and Ince (1957), Darrigol (2005), Eckert (2006), and Calero (2008) are particularly useful.  The last three are complementary:  Calero covers the period from Huyghens, Marriotte, and Newton, to Euler and Lagrange; Darrigol takes the story from the Bernoullis to Prandtl; and Eckert begins with Prandtl and ends on the eve of WWII.
