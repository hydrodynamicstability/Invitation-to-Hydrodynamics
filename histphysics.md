## Fluid Mechanics and the History of Physics

"A fluid is any body whose parts yield to any force applied to it and yielding are moved easily with respect to one another."  

&emsp; -- Sir Isaac Newton, *Principia Mathematica*, Book 2, Section 5.

"A fluid is a body the contiguous parts of which act on one another with a pressure which is perpendicular to the interface which separates those parts....A great many substances may be found which perfectly fulfil this definition of a fluid when they are at rest, and they are therefore called fluids.  But no existing fluid fulfils the definition when it is in motion.  In a fluid in motion the pressures at a point may be greater in one direction than in another, or, what is the same thing, the force between two parts may not be perpendicular to the interface which separates those parts.  If a fluid could be found which fulfilled the defintion when in motion as well as when at rest, it would be called a Perfect Fluid.  All actual fluids are imperfect, and exhibit the phenomenon of internal friction or viscosity, by which their motion after being stirred about in a vessel is gradually stopped, and the energy of the motion is converted into heat."

**Welcome.**  In the following, I present some thoughts about fluid mechanics and the history of physics.

### Introduction

Most physicists attribute the beginning of *field theory* to Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell in the 19th century.  It is true that theirs was the first *force field theory*; however it borrows a great deal of its mathematics from *mechanical* field theories that originated in the 18th century with Leonhard Euler and other Enlightenment savants.  Consequently much of the vector calculus of electromagnetism retains a distinctly hydrodynamic character, as illustrated in this [video lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB4C3YfSZyU&list=PL8_xPU5epJddRABXqJ5h5G0dk-XGtA5cZ&index=36) from *The Mechanical Universe and Beyond*, by Prof. David Goodstein.

The greatest classical physicists of all time, Galileo, Newton, Faraday, and Maxwell, all investigated fluid mechanics, though their primary influence on the subject is indirect, through their laying of the foundations of classical mechanics, electromagnetism, and kinetic theory.  Albert Einstein's foray into aerodynamics is more questionable.

### Galileo

Galileo Galilei wrote a *Discourse on Floating Bodies* (1612), controversial at the time for its quarrelsome, pro-Archimedian, anti-Aristotelian arguments, but is mostly forgotten today.  Stillman Drake believes this obscurity is undeserved, for "The *Discourse* is distinguished among other works of its time by its repeated recourse to observational and experimental data in opposition to philosophical doctrines.  Moreover, the experiments proposed require no elaborate equipment and no technique beyond reasonable patience and care."  However Galileo's account of air resistance encountered by a pendulum, in his *Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences* (1638), was challenged almost immediately by Marin Mersenne's experimental results, and is considered incorrect today.  In this connection, later writers speculate that Galileo reported on experiments that he never actually did.

### Newton

Sir Isaac Newton's *Principia Mathematica* (1687) is divided into three books.  Most of Book 2 is on fluid mechanics, and Clifford Truesdell famously described the material as "almost entirely original" though "much of it is false".  For example, Newton was the first ever to publish an estimate of the speed of sound in air, but he could not reconcile his prediction with later experimental measurements.  (Laplace later showed that Newton neglected to account for heat variations.) However Book 2 does contain enduring contributions, and *Newtonian fluids* are named in its author's honor.

### Faraday

According to Peter A. Davidson, Michael Faraday "tried to measure the voltage induced by the Thames flowing through the Earth's magnetic field", allegedly the "first experiment" in magnetohydrodynamics.  After 3 days of effort at the Waterloo bridge, "I could not...obtain any satisfactory results."  (An illustration of this experiment may be found [here](https://nyheritage.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p16694coll20/id/327/).)

### Maxwell (and Boltzmann)

Keith Moffatt writes of James Clerk Maxwell's research in hydrodynamics:  "his publications were few but nevertheless ground-breaking in their originality".  Of course, as mentioned, the conceptual and mathematical appartus of hydrodynamic theory was employed by Maxwell in the early stages of developing his electromagnetic field theory.  Meanwhile, after Maxwell's first paper on the kinetic theory of gases, he and his wife Katherine carried out a series of experiments to measure the viscosity of air at various conditions, confirming that it is independent of pressure.  Elizabeth Garber says that these experiments, published in 1866, "became one of the most significant pieces of evidence in favour of his kinetic theory".  Maxwell's second paper on kinetic theory (1867) shows how the Navier-Stokes equations may be obtained within the theory.  Ludwig Boltzmann, of course, completed Maxwell's kinetic theory; but also a cryptic passage in Serrin (1958) claims that Boltzmann was the first to propose that the symmetry of the Cauchy stress tensor be an axiom, rather than a theorem (as Cauchy had presented it).

### Helmholtz and Kelvin

Of course, two of the 19th century's greatest thermodynamicists were also among its greatest hydrodynamicists:  Hermann von Helmholtz and William Thomson (Lord Kelvin).  They contributed fundamental work to both fields (and Kelvin, in addition, to electromagnetism).  To mention just a few examples in hydrodynamics:  Helmholtz's vortex theorems and Kelvin's circulation theorem are fundamental for inviscid flows; the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is named after them both.  Helmholtz was the first to define vorticity.

### Einstein's folly

Using a fallacious argument based on the Venturi effect, Albert Einstein to propose a "cat's back" airfoil design in 1916 that failed miserably when tested by a Berlin aircraft company.  The test pilot, Paul Ehrhardt, survived, but years later, a few months before Einstein died, he told Ehrhardt "I have often been ashamed of my folly of those days."  (A second test pilot, Otto Reichert, crashed but survived.)  "Einstein's folly" is discussed by Bloor (2011, pp. 296-302) and Calaprice et al. (2015, p. 297).  Bloor writes that "Einstein had little knowledge of current developments in the field of aerodynamics.  This episode is a salutory reminder of the difference between fundamental physics and technical mechanics.  Eminence in the former does not guarantee competence in the latter."
