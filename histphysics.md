## Fluid Mechanics and the History of Physics

"A fluid is any body whose parts yield to any force applied to it and yielding are moved easily with respect to one another."  

&emsp; -- Sir Isaac Newton, *Principia Mathematica*, Book 2, Section 5.

"A fluid is a body the contiguous parts of which act on one another with a pressure which is perpendicular to the interface which separates those parts....A great many substances may be found which perfectly fulfil this definition of a fluid when they are at rest, and they are therefore called fluids.  But no existing fluid fulfils the definition when it is in motion.  In a fluid in motion the pressures at a point may be greater in one direction than in another, or, what is the same thing, the force between two parts may not be perpendicular to the interface which separates those parts.  If a fluid could be found which fulfilled the defintion when in motion as well as when at rest, it would be called a Perfect Fluid.  All actual fluids are imperfect, and exhibit the phenomenon of internal friction or viscosity, by which their motion after being stirred about in a vessel is gradually stopped, and the energy of the motion is converted into heat."

&emsp; -- James Clerk Maxwell. *Theory of Heat*, 2d edition (Longmans, Green, 1888).



**Welcome.**  In the following, I present some thoughts about fluid mechanics and the history of physics.
